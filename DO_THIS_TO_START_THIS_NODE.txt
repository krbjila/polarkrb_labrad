1. make sure the node is running on the main experimental control computer (krbjila)
2. go to ./batch/
3. run the two files there in order
4. should be good to go!

troubleshooting:
1. on krbjila, run "ifconfig" in the terminal
2. check that the ip address is still 128.138.107.174
3. if it isn't for some reason, need to update the environment variable LABRADHOST on THIS computer to reflect the new ip address
